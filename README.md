# Basic-Python-Calculator
My first project with Python. Originally made sometime in mid 2025, I picked this project back up in early 2026 because I wanted to continue learning Python.
Current features:
- GUI built with tkinter and ttk
- Basic arithmetic: + - * /
- Keyboard shortcuts for selecting operations, calculating (ENTER), and exiting (CTRL+Q)
- Error handling: Division by zero, invalid input (non-numbers), no operation selected
- Floating point support
- Clear function to reset all inputs and selected operation
- Basic styling and layout
- Cosmetic button click effects

Future plans (so far):
- More operations
- Memory functions
- History log
- Proper window size + more styling/theming
- Possibly more inputs and operations
