# Basic-Python-Calculator

## Version 0.3.1
My first project with Python. Originally made sometime in mid 2025, I picked this project back up in early 2026 because I wanted to continue learning Python.

## Current features
- GUI built with tkinter and ttk
- Basic arithmetic and exponents
- Keyboard shortcuts for selecting operations, calculating (ENTER), and exiting (CTRL+Q)
- Error handling and error logging
- Floating point support
- Clear function to reset all inputs and selected operation
- History log for previous calculations
- Basic settings menu
- Secret easter eggs..?? 👀

## Changelog (v0.3.1)
- Theme toggle (only light and dark theme for now)
- Backend UI changes
- Bugfixes

## Future plans (so far)
- More operations and inputs
- Memory functions
- More style and theming
