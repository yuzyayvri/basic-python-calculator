# Basic-Python-Calculator
*v0.2.1*

My first project with Python. Originally made sometime in mid 2025, I picked this project back up in early 2026 because I wanted to continue learning Python.

## Current features
- GUI built with tkinter and ttk
- Basic arithmetic: + - * /
- Keyboard shortcuts for selecting operations, calculating (ENTER), and exiting (CTRL+Q)
- Error handling: Division by zero, invalid input (non-numbers), no operation selected
- Floating point support
- Clear function to reset all inputs and selected operation
- Basic styling and layout

## Latest developments
- Exponent (^) functionality
- History log for past calculations
- Functions dictionary for more efficient calculations
- Better GUI (bigger window size)
- Overall improved efficiency & structure of code

## Future plans (so far)
- More operations and inputs
- Memory functions
- History log
- More styling and theming
