# Basic-Python-Calculator
*v0.2.3*

My first project with Python. Originally made sometime in mid 2025, I picked this project back up in early 2026 because I wanted to continue learning Python.

## Current features
- GUI built with tkinter and ttk
- Basic arithmetic and exponents
- Keyboard shortcuts for selecting operations, calculating (ENTER), and exiting (CTRL+Q)
- Error handling and error logging
- Floating point support
- Clear function to reset all inputs and selected operation
- History log for previous calculations

## Latest developments
- Settings window
- Easter eggs checkbox option

## Future plans (so far)
- More operations and inputs
- Memory functions
- Style and theming

## Error codes

    - Invalid operation error. Usually means user did not select any operation.

    - Zero division error. Usually means user tried to divide by zero.
- ERR:valErr
    - Value error. Usually means user inputted a non-number.
